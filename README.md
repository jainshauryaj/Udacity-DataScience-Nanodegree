# Udacity-DataScience-Nanodegree

The Data Scientist Nanodegree program is an advanced program designed to prepare you for data scientist
jobs. As such, you should have a high comfort level with a variety of topics before starting the program. In
order to successfully complete this program, we strongly recommend that the following prerequisites are
fulfilled. If you do not have the necessary prerequisites, Udacity has courses and programs that prepare you
for this Nanodegree program.

## Programming:
• Python Programming: Writing functions, logic, control flow, and building basic applications, as well as
 common data analysis libraries like NumPy and pandas.
 
• SQL programming: Querying databases using joins, aggregations, and subqueries

• Comfortable with using the Terminal, version control in Git, and using GitHub

## Probability and Statistics:
• Descriptive Statistics: Calculating measures of center and spread, estimation distributions

• Inferential Statistics: Sampling distributions, hypothesis testing

• Probability: Probability theory, conditional probability

## Mathematics:
• Calculus: Maximizing and minimizing algebraic equations

• Linear Algebra: Matrix manipulation and multiplication

Data wrangling:
• Accessing database, CSV, and JSON data

• Data cleaning and transformations using pandas and Sklearn

Data visualization with matplotlib:
• Exploratory data analysis and visualization

• Explanatory data visualizations and dashboards

## Machine Learning:
• Feature Engineering

• Supervised Learning: Regression, classification, decision trees, random forest

• Unsupervised Learning: PCA, Clustering

## IN COLLABORATION WITH:
• Use principles of statistics and probability to design and execute A/B tests and recommendation engines to assist businesses in making data-automated decisions..

• Deploy a data science solution to a basic flask app.

• Manipulate and analyze distributed datasets using Apache Spark.

• Communicate results effectively to stakeholders.
